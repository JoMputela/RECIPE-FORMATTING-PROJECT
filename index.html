				<em><strong><h2><u>Method</u></h2></strong></em>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 160¬∫C/325¬∫F/gas 3. Cover the porcini with boiling kettle water and leave to rehydrate. Season the beef cheeks with sea salt and black pepper, then brown them in a large casserole pan on a high heat with a splash of oil, turning until well coloured all over. </li>

			<li>Meanwhile, slice the pancetta into lardons. Peel the celery, onions and carrots, then chop into rough 1cm dice. In a pestle and mortar, crush the cloves with 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, then peel and pound in the fresh garlic.</li>

			<li>When brown, push the cheeks to one side of the pan and reduce to a medium heat. Add the pancetta and cinnamon, stirring until the pancetta is lightly golden. </li>

			<li>Drain the porcini, reserving the liquor, then roughly chop and add to the pan with the veg. Tie the herbs together, then stir in with the garlic mixture. Fry for 15 minutes, or until soft, stirring occasionally.</li>

		 	<li>Pour in the wine, let it reduce by half, then pour in the reserved porcini water (discarding just the last gritty bit) and the passata. Fill the passata bottle with water and pour into the pan. Cover with a scrunched-up sheet of wet greaseproof paper and a lid.</li>

			<li>Cook in the oven for 4 hours, or until the meat is outrageously tender and the sauce has thickened. Taste the sauce and season, if needed, then serve up however you wish.</li>

<p class="p1"><font>‚ÄúBeef cheeks, when cooked gently, are one of the most delicious parts of the whole animal. Inspired by Nonna Miriam and her obsession for slow-cooking and making tough, cheaper cuts of meat the hero, this is amazing served with mashed potato, crusty bread or oozy polenta, or even tossed with freshly cooked pasta.‚Äù</font></p>

	Calories are just a unit of energy. If you eat more than you use you can gain weight, or lose it if you don't eat enough. How much you need depends on your weight, gender and how active you are, but it's around 2,000 a day.">
	<td>We all need to eat a small amount of fat because it protects our organs and helps us grow. But we need to be careful about how much fat we eat and what kinds of fat, because in higher levels it's associated with weight gain, diabetes, cancer and heart disease.</td>
	
                          
	<td>Saturated or "bad fats" are in beef, pork, chicken skin, butter, cream and cheese. Too much can be bad for our heart and cholesterol levels, but unsaturated or "good fats" in fish, nuts, avocados and some oils can help keep our hearts healthy if eaten in moderation.</td>

	<td>Protein helps our muscles to grow and repair, as well as providing you with essential amino acids. When it comes to protein, try to eat leaner sources such as chicken and fish or non-meat sources such as eggs, dairy, beans, nuts, seeds, tofu and pulses.</td>
	<td>Carbs are a great source of energy and, excluding foods such as potatoes, are made from grains - like bread, pasta and cereal. We all need carbs, but try to make them all wholegrain by sticking to brown bread, rice and pasta - they are much more nutritious.</td>
	<td>We all deserve a treat sometimes, but try to limit your sugar intake. Most of your sugar should come from raw fruit and milk, because they give us lots of nutrients too. Always check food labels so you know how much sugar you're eating.</td>
	<td>Although we need a small amount of salt in our diets to help regulate the amount of water in our bodies and other bodily functions, there is a strong link between consuming too much salt and bad health. Too much salt can damage our organs and increases the risk of disease.</td>
	<td>Fibre is classed as a carbohydrate and is mainly found in plant-based foods. We should be aiming for about 30g of fibre each day, to help other food and waste pass through the gut and keep our insides happy, fibre also helps to reduce blood cholesterol.</td>
